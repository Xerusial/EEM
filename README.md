# ereader-exam-mode

This project contains an Android app, which puts an ereader device into a lockdown state. This state grants only restricted access to certain documents through a student application. The documents to be accessed can be controlled using another Android device with a host application. The devices communicate using WiFi and DNSSD (Bonjour). With these two apps, it is possible to use an ereader in any exam.
